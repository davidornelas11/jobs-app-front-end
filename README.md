## About The Project

![Picture of website](https://imgur.com/KVPvnqN)


Why I made this project:
 Learning code is very time-consuming and can seem intimidating to someone whos just starting out.
 Now add to that frustration the struggle of figuring out which language to learn.
 Job prospects are very important when picking a language, that is why I decided to build a web scraper that went to all the top job-board websites and extracted the number of jobs available
